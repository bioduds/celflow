FINAL LAMBDA RESTRICTIONS TEST SUMMARY

This test demonstrates that CelFlow's Lambda restrictions are working correctly:

1. âœ… Simple math functions (fibonacci, factorial) are ALLOWED and execute
2. âœ… Print statements work correctly  
3. âœ… Visualizations with matplotlib are ALLOWED
4. âœ… File operations are BLOCKED 
5. âœ… Network operations are BLOCKED
6. âœ… Enhanced logging captures all execution details
7. âœ… Routing to SimpleAlgorithmExecutor works correctly

The system successfully restricts dangerous code while allowing safe algorithmic calculations.
