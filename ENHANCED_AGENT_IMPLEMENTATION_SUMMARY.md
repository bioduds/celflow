3. Creates workflow: Search → Analyze → Respond
4. Executes: DuckDuckGo search for current weather
5. Synthesizes: Natural language response with real data

### Enhanced Prompt Engineering

The system uses sophisticated prompts that:
- **Describe Available Tools**: Dynamic tool descriptions based on context
- **Guide Workflow Planning**: Step-by-step task decomposition instructions
- **Enable JSON Responses**: Structured output for tool calls
- **Preserve Context**: Conversation history and user preferences

### Safety and Reliability

- **Tool Sandboxing**: All tool execution is contained and monitored
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic fallback to simpler approaches
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter checking
- **Resource Limits**: Execution time and resource constraints
- **Audit Logging**: Complete tool usage tracking
