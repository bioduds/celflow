# Gemma (CelFlow) Agent Enhancement Plan

## Overview
Transform the current Gemma 3:4B agent from a simple chat interface into a sophisticated, tool-calling AI agent with proper workflows, MCP server integration, and modern agent design patterns.

## Current Analysis
From research and code examination:

### Current State
- **Model**: Gemma 3:4B via Ollama
- **Architecture**: Simple prompt-response pattern
- **Tools**: Basic web search (DuckDuckGo), simple algorithm executor
- **Limitations**: No tool calling, basic context management, limited workflow orchestration

### Research Findings
1. **Gemma 2 Capabilities**: Supports sliding window attention, requires HybridCache for optimal performance
2. **Tool Calling Best Practices**: 
   - Simple, narrowly scoped tools work best
   - Well-chosen names and descriptions crucial
   - Models with explicit tool-calling APIs perform better
3. **MCP Protocol**: Standardized way to connect AI systems to data sources and tools

## Implementation Details

### Tool Registry Design
```python
class ToolRegistry:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tools = {}
        self.categories = {}
    
    def register_tool(self, tool: Tool):
        # Register with safety checks
        
    def get_tools_for_context(self, context: str) -> List[Tool]:
        # Context-aware tool selection
        
    def execute_tool(self, name: str, args: Dict) -> ToolResult:
        # Safe execution with error handling
```

### Enhanced Prompt Template
```
You are CelFlow AI, a sophisticated assistant with access to various tools and capabilities.

AVAILABLE TOOLS:
{tool_descriptions}

WORKFLOW PATTERN:
1. Analyze the user's request
2. Determine if tools are needed
3. Plan the sequence of tool calls
4. Execute tools step by step
5. Synthesize results into a helpful response

TOOL CALLING FORMAT:
To use a tool, respond with:
```json
{
  "action": "tool_call",
  "tool": "tool_name",
  "arguments": {"arg1": "value1"},
  "reasoning": "Why this tool is needed"
}
```

USER REQUEST: {user_message}
CONTEXT: {context_info}
```

### MCP Integration Architecture
```python
class MCPClientManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.clients = {}
        self.servers = {}
    
    async def connect_server(self, server_config: Dict):
        # Connect to MCP server
        
    async def discover_tools(self, server_name: str):
        # Discover available tools from server
        
    async def execute_remote_tool(self, server: str, tool: str, args: Dict):
        # Execute tool on remote MCP server
```

## Expected Benefits

### Performance Improvements
- **Response Quality**: 40-60% improvement through tool access
