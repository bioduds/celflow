# CelFlow Lambda Restrictions Implementation Summary

## üéØ Objective Completed
Successfully implemented restricted Lambda code execution for the Gemma model in CelFlow to prevent unnecessary and complex code execution while maintaining essential algorithmic capabilities.

## ‚úÖ Key Achievements

### 1. Simple Algorithm Executor Created
- **File**: `backend/app/ai/simple_algorithm_executor.py`

- **Capabilities**:
  - Prime number generation
  - Fibonacci sequences  
  - Basic statistics (count, sum, mean, min, max)
  - Simple sorting and filtering
  - Mathematical calculations
  - **NEW**: Visualization support with matplotlib (restricted)

### 2. Central AI Brain Integration
- **File**: `backend/app/ai/central_brain.py` 
- **Enhancement**: Intelligent routing between Simple and Full executors
- **Logic**: 
  - Analyzes code complexity and purpose
  - Routes simple algorithmic tasks to restricted executor
  - Routes complex tasks to full executor
  - Provides clear logging and decision rationale

### 3. Enhanced Logging System
- **File**: `backend/app/core/enhanced_logging.py`
- **Features**:
  - Structured JSON logging for Lambda executions
  - Routing decision tracking
  - User interaction monitoring
  - Detailed execution metrics
  - Better debugging visibility

### 4. Visualization Support
- **Capability**: Simple plots and charts using matplotlib
- **Restrictions**: 
  - Only matplotlib and numpy allowed for visualization
  - No network requests or file operations
  - Plots saved to files (non-interactive mode)
  - Execution time limits enforced
