### **Success Metrics**
- [ ] Service runs invisibly with <5% CPU usage
- [ ] All 15 embryos actively detecting patterns
- [ ] Privacy filtering blocks 100% of sensitive data
- [ ] User can monitor progress through tray menu
- [ ] System handles 8+ hours of continuous operation
- [ ] Ready for first agent birth within 1-2 weeks

This implementation plan takes us from concept to working embryo pool in 2 weeks, with the first AI agent birth happening shortly after. Each phase builds naturally on the previous one, creating an emergent system that grows more capable over time.
